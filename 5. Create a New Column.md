# 5. Create a New Column

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Tags:** Pandas, DataFrame Manipulation

## Problem Description

You are given a DataFrame `employees` with the following schema:

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| name        | object  |
| salary      | int     |

A company plans to provide its employees with a bonus.

Write a Pandas solution to create a new column `bonus` that contains **double** the value of the `salary` column.

The result should return the modified DataFrame.

## Example

**Input:**

```text
DataFrame employees
+---------+--------+
| name    | salary |
+---------+--------+
| Piper   | 4548   |
| Grace   | 28150  |
| Georgia | 1103   |
| Willow  | 6593   |
| Finn    | 74576  |
| Thomas  | 24433  |
+---------+--------+
```

**Output:**

```text
+---------+--------+--------+
| name    | salary | bonus  |
+---------+--------+--------+
| Piper   | 4548   | 9096   |
| Grace   | 28150  | 56300  |
| Georgia | 1103   | 2206   |
| Willow  | 6593   | 13186  |
| Finn    | 74576  | 149152 |
| Thomas  | 24433  | 48866  |
+---------+--------+--------+
```

**Explanation:**  
The `bonus` column is created by multiplying each `salary` value by 2.

## Solution Code

```python
import pandas as pd

def createBonusColumn(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Ensure it's a DataFrame (optional, for safety)
    df = pd.DataFrame(employees)
    
    # Create the bonus column by doubling the salary
    df['bonus'] = 2 * df['salary']
    
    return df
```

---

## How It Works

1. The `pd.DataFrame(employees)` ensures the input is treated as a proper DataFrame.
2. The new column `bonus` is created by vectorized multiplication: `df['salary'] * 2`.
3. The resulting DataFrame with the new column is returned.

This solution is efficient because Pandas handles vectorized operations internally without the need for loops.
