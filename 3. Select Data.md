# 3. Select Data

## Problem Description

You are given a DataFrame named `students` with the following structure:

| Column Name | Type   |
|-------------|--------|
| student_id  | int    |
| name        | object |
| age         | int    |

Write a function using **Pandas** to return the **name** and **age** of the student whose `student_id` is 101.

## Example Input

### DataFrame `students`:

| student_id | name    | age |
|------------|---------|-----|
| 101        | Ulysses | 13  |
| 53         | William | 10  |
| 128        | Henry   | 6   |
| 3          | Henry   | 11  |

### Expected Output:

| name    | age |
|---------|-----|
| Ulysses | 13  |

## Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code

```python
import pandas as pd

def selectData(students: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return students.loc[students['student_id'] == 101, ['name', 'age']]
```

### Line-by-Line Breakdown:

1. `import pandas as pd`  
   - This imports the Pandas library, which is essential for working with DataFrames in Python.

2. `def selectData(students: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:`  
   - Defines a function named `selectData` that takes a single parameter `students` which is a Pandas DataFrame.
   - The function will return another DataFrame, as indicated by `-> pd.DataFrame`.

3. `students['student_id'] == 101`  
   - This creates a **Boolean mask**, i.e., a series of `True` or `False` values indicating whether each rowâ€™s `student_id` is 101.

4. `students.loc[...]`  
   - `.loc[]` is used for label-based indexing.
   - `students.loc[students['student_id'] == 101]` filters the DataFrame to only include the row(s) where the condition is `True`.

5. `[['name', 'age']]`  
   - This selects only the `name` and `age` columns from the filtered result.

6. The final result is a **new DataFrame** with only the required data: name and age of the student with `student_id` 101.

- **Label-based indexing with `.loc[]`**
- **Subsetting DataFrames**
