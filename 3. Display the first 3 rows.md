## Problem Statement

You are given a Pandas DataFrame named `employees` with the following columns:

- `employee_id` (int)
- `name` (object)
- `department` (object)
- `salary` (int)

Write a function to **display the first 3 rows** of the DataFrame.

### Example Input

```python
employees = pd.DataFrame({
    "employee_id": [3, 90, 9, 60, 49, 43],
    "name": ["Bob", "Alice", "Tatiana", "Annabelle", "Jonathan", "Khaled"],
    "department": ["Operations", "Sales", "Engineering", "InformationTechnology", "HumanResources", "Administration"],
    "salary": [48675, 11096, 33805, 37678, 23793, 40454]
})
```

---

### Expected Output

```python
   employee_id     name   department  salary
0            3      Bob   Operations   48675
1           90    Alice        Sales   11096
2            9  Tatiana  Engineering   33805
```

---

## Solution

```python
import pandas as pd

def selectFirstRows(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    df = pd.DataFrame(employees)  # Not strictly necessary, but safe if input isn't a DataFrame
    df = df[:3]                   
    return df
```

---

## Explanation

- `df[:3]` returns the first three rows of the DataFrame.  
- In Pandas, slicing like `df[:N]` is equivalent to saying "give me the first N rows."
- This is a simple but commonly used technique for inspecting the head of a dataset.

This approach works efficiently and is accepted by LeetCode.
