# 1. Create a DataFrame from List

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Question ID**: 2877  


---

## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D list named `student_data` that contains student information. Each inner list represents a student, where:
- The first element is the student's ID
- The second element is the student's age

> Your task is to create a **Pandas DataFrame** with two columns:
- `student_id`
- `age`

> The output DataFrame should **preserve the order** of the input list.

---

## Example

### Input:
```python
student_data = [
  [1, 15],
  [2, 11],
  [3, 11],
  [4, 20]
]
```

### Output (as a DataFrame):
```
+------------+-----+
| student_id | age |
+------------+-----+
|     1      | 15  |
|     2      | 11  |
|     3      | 11  |
|     4      | 20  |
+------------+-----+
```

---

## Thought Process

- The input is a simple list of lists, and we are asked to convert it into a DataFrame.
- We need to assign column names explicitly to match the required output format.
- The order of data must be retained.

---

## Final Code

```python
import pandas as pd
from typing import List

def createDataframe(student_data: List[List[int]]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    df = pd.DataFrame(student_data, columns=['student_id', 'age'])
    return df
```

---

## Explanation

- `pd.DataFrame(...)` creates a DataFrame from the list of lists.
- The `columns` argument explicitly names the two columns:
  - `'student_id'` â†’ first element of each sublist.
  - `'age'` â†’ second element of each sublist.
- Since the input is already ordered, the output will naturally retain that order.

## ðŸ“˜ Notes

- This is one of the most basic and common operations in data preprocessing.
- Important to understand column labeling and how list of lists maps to rows.
