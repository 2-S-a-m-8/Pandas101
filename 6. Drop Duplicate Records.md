# 6. Drop Duplicate Rows

## Problem Description

You are given a DataFrame `customers` with the following structure:

| Column Name  | Type   |
|--------------|--------|
| customer_id  | int    |
| name         | object |
| email        | object |

There are duplicate rows in the DataFrame based on the `email` column. The goal is to **remove these duplicates** while **keeping only the first occurrence of each email**.

### Example

#### Input:

| customer_id | name    | email               |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| 1           | Ella    | emily@example.com   |
| 2           | David   | michael@example.com |
| 3           | Zachary | sarah@example.com   |
| 4           | Alice   | john@example.com    |
| 5           | Finn    | john@example.com    |
| 6           | Violet  | alice@example.com   |

#### Output:

| customer_id | name    | email               |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| 1           | Ella    | emily@example.com   |
| 2           | David   | michael@example.com |
| 3           | Zachary | sarah@example.com   |
| 4           | Alice   | john@example.com    |
| 6           | Violet  | alice@example.com   |

### Explanation:

Both Alice (ID 4) and Finn (ID 5) share `john@example.com`. We keep only Alice (the first occurrence) and drop Finn.

## Solution Code

```python
import pandas as pd

def dropDuplicateEmails(customers: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Create a copy of the DataFrame (to avoid modifying the original)
    df = pd.DataFrame(customers)
    
    # Drop duplicate rows based on the 'email' column
    # keep='first' ensures we retain the first occurrence and drop subsequent duplicates
    df = df.drop_duplicates(keep='first', subset=['email'])
    
    # Return the cleaned DataFrame
    return df
```

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Why `pd.DataFrame(customers)`?**  
   This ensures weâ€™re working with a DataFrame copy and not altering the input object.

2. **Why `drop_duplicates`?**  
   - `drop_duplicates()` is a built-in Pandas method that removes duplicates.
   - `subset=['email']` specifies that duplicates are determined only based on the `email` column.
   - `keep='first'` keeps the **first occurrence** of each unique email and removes all others.

3. **Return Value**  
   The function returns a new DataFrame that contains only unique emails, preserving the order of the first occurrences.
